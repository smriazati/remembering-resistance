        "text": "<p>To our house one day came Polishtchuk and Ostomenka from the police. They ordered my father to establish a “Judenrat” in Tuchyn and to serve as its head. My father was always the &ldquo;<em>soltis</em>&rdquo; in Tuchyn (crowned) and everyone knew him. Maybe because of that they turned to him. My mother opposed this completely, that my father should take on this role. I know that my father also did not want this, but he had no choice. The Germans did not ask him. They forced this job on him. Despite this, many Jews turned to my father and asked him to take the position. He was the man in Tuchyn who in orderly times would sort out the issues of the Jews in the government offices.</p><p>The Judenrat was established. The Jewish population placed their trust in my father. The Judenrat in Tuchyn may indeed have carried the name, but in practice it functioned as an eye of the Jewish community. Appointed as my father's deputy was Meir Himelfarb, who was a respected Jew in the town. He too was a merchant. As members of the Judenrat were chosen: Yosef Rotenberg, Elik Chomut, Berel Zaltzman, Chaim Glatshtein, Krishtol, Aharon Marakish. Other Jews would help the Judenrat in times of need. The secretary of the Judenrat was Yosef Rotenberg. In the secretariat worked three young women: Chaya Apel, Basia Valdman, and me (Manya Shvartzman).</p><p>One day Grabner called in Getzel Shvartzman and told him: “In Tuchyn there is no ghetto and in order to know who is a Jew, from this day and on, all the Jews must wear two yellow patches, one on the chest and the second on the back.” (Until that day the Jews of Tuchyn wore on the left arm a white stripe on which had been stitched a blue Star of David.) My father tried to reduce the evil of this decree. He spoke to Grabner's heart, a gift was also presented to him, and the matter of the patches was forgotten for a certain time, until my father was summoned again to Grabner and this time he was informed that it was impossible to delay the order any longer and the Jews of Tuchyn had to wear the two patches. You of course do not need to wear the patches, Grabner consoled my father. But he replied: “I am a Jew and I will wear the patches like all the Jews.”</p><p>The Germans distributed work cards. A Jew who did not have a work card could expect to be deported and sometimes worse than that. Every Jew from the age of 14 had to work.</p>",

        "text": "<h3>English Testimony by Miriam Schwartzman-Koutz</h3><p>In 1941, with the outbreak of the war, the Germans advanced with giant strides. The Germans entered Tuchyn at the beginning of July [1941]. About two weeks after the outbreak of the war, during their retreat, the Soviets transferred to the Soviet Union all the people who had been working in government offices. Many young Jews escaped in the wake of the Red Army.</p><p>On the Horyn River was a bridge that connected Tuchyn with the Ukrainian village Shubkiv. During their retreat, the Russians blew up this bridge. The Ukrainian population received the Germans with enthusiasm. They helped the German army enter the city. They placed boats at their disposal and helped their boats cross the Horyn River. Fear fell upon the Jews of Tuchyn. Every family looked for a place to hide. Many families left their homes. It seemed to the Jews that it was worth dispersing to houses further away, that stood at the edge of the city.</p><p>…</p><p>They thoroughly examined the bundles in the hands of the Jews, whom they had stopped in the street. They were searching for weapons. The Ukrainians led the Germans to the houses of the Jews and pointed to the homes in which Jews lived. In Moshe Giterman's house that day were a number of families – around 50 people. The Germans went into the house, ordered all of us to go outside, and ordered us to raise our arms. They carried out a search inside the house, and when they did not find anything they ordered us to disperse and for each person to return to his own home.</p><p>The German soldiers set themselves up in Tuchyn. In the first days they took over all the offices: city hall, the post office, the schools. In those initial days they left people in their homes. </p><p>…</p><p>The Ukrainians felt themselves to be the masters of the city. Not just from Tuchyn, but also from the villages in the area, Ukrainians began arriving with sacks in their hands. They would break in to the houses of the Jews and fill the sacks with clothing, bedding, and anything that had value. About a week after the entry of the Germans, the first pogrom in Tuchyn was carried out by Ukrainians. The organizers were sons of the city who during the time of the Russians had cooperated with them and declared their loyalty to the Soviets. Already in the first days [of the German occupation], they changed their colors. At the head of the rioters stood: Rytchak the lame, Prokofchik, Ostomenka, Prokop Polishtchuk, and others.</p>",

        "text": "<h3>English Account by Miriam Schwartzman Koutz</h3><p>In July 1942 the order came from the Gebietskommissar to establish a ghetto in Tuczyn. The order was signed by Dr. Bayer. The Judenrat tried to defer the order in various ways, but all the efforts and attempts this time were in vain. They began to build a fence for the ghetto, the building of which took about three weeks. The Judenrat decided to delay the work as much as possible. They sent people to build the fence and explained to them that there was no reason to hurry.</p><p> …</p><h3>English Account by Yitzchak Chomut (Isaac Emmett)</h3> <p>They … told us that in a few days we would have to leave our homes and come to the ghetto.  We knew this was the beginning of the end for us.  The tension was terrible.</p><p>Some Ukrainian men went from one Jew to the next and promised to save each of us from death.  They said that as long as the Jews were in the ghetto, they would bring food to them. In return, they wanted everything that was in our houses.  We felt hopeless. We knew the Ukrainians were lying. But we also knew that we could not take our belongings with us to the ghetto.</p><p>Four days before Yom Kippur 1942, we were told that we had until Tuesday (the day after Yom Kippur), to be in the ghetto.  Any Jews found outside the ghetto would be killed.  All the entrances to town were blocked by the Ukranian Militz and German SS men.  The panic was terrible.</p><p>On the day before Yom Kippur, the Czechoslavakian wife of the school's pricipal came to see us.  She brought an order from the Geminah.  It stated that we needed to leave our house and move to the ghetto.  After we left, the principal and his wife would move in.  Our house was a newly built beautiful home with many conveniences.  I had bought the ground and patterned the house after the latest model.  It was furnished in 1940.  The woman watched us as we packed for the ghetto.  We cried and she cried with us.  Our older daughter Hannah came in the room.  She was eleven years old.  The woman saw our beautiful, loving child.  She was our crown, exceptional in all ways, fine, and gentle.  The woman thought for a while and then told us that it would be a a sin for such a beautiful and loving child to go to the ghetto.  She asked if she could take her in as her own child so she could be saved.  She had no children and was fifty years old.  We had no other options so we decided to let her take our dear child.  Maybe she would be saved.  Some of our friends told us how lucky we were to have the chance to save at least one child.  The day we moved to the ghetto, the Lamatchuk family moved into our house.  We went to the house in the ghetto of my wife's mother, while our dear daughter stayed in our house.</p>",
