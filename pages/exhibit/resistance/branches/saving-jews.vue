          <p>
            00:27:24 Pavlov, the only way, he would get nervous he had a dog
            named briscoe.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:27:32 And he would whistle that will save their lives every time
            that he wanted to come to us, he would whistle for the dog.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:27:39 And the dog was come and he would say something with with
            the dog and the dog running around all around the farm and then come
            back.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:27:47 And if he told them nobody was around desperately will come
            to us so that talk was alive safer, if someone was nearby that will
            be barking he wasn't on us, so he was safer to go and he could join
            us.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:28:01 He had on him a huge code with pockets and he would put the
            food in his pocket, and he couldn't give as much because he was very
            poor a piece of bread a beloved a soup a bottle of water.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:28:13 And he would try once a day or maybe every other day come
            into the barn like he would be getting hey I for the horses, you
            know he had all this, not just the coming he always came out doing
            something there wouldn't be suspicious funny buddy and he would.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:28:29 Give us that stuff and once tonight, he gave us a path for
            elimination.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:28:37 And that was the most That was the most dangerous part of
            the whole a two months of hiding, because once tonight, the same
            thing he would call the dog briscoe.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:28:48 And the dog will be money well and make sure there's no one
            around and to end he would go from the outside of the bond and take
            that and piece of the sled.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:28:59 And my father was call out with path and that's not far
            from there, there was a little river and he bestowed into the
            vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:29:07 And, but it was very dangerous thing to do, because you
            never knew, you know if anybody, even though the dog, you know so
            dog and so when he could, of course, when he couldn't it would go on
            some more than a day or at night because usually tonight that that
            would happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:29:24 The piece of whether we had we had to share with mice mice
            are always around they were up as bodies, they wanted the bread that
            you had to hold it like this, otherwise they would grab it out of
            your hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:29:36 And, and I was very fearful always have mice and if you get
            used to it lies like unbelievable were covered with lice by three
            o'clock in the afternoon, we had no light at all the only light, we
            had was between this last of the boot.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:29:58 And in order for my father and mother and myself to keep
            saying, my father would teach me the Bible by heart, I knew the
            whole Bible my heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:30:07 Every day, you know, he would teach me something else, and
            when he would forget a word I will remind him, so I became like very
            religious obviously reciting something from the Bible, and also.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:30:21 Pavlov my mother asked for wall and she started knitting.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:30:26 knitting with all the MICE and and and the lies, but I must
            she was living I remember, leaving all kinds of sweaters for the
            girls.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:30:34 And my father, he would put it in my father would cough
            shoes for from boot just do something and then the children will go
            to church and everybody wants to know what made you this beautiful
            shoes and home agencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:30:48 It had to create all kinds of stories for that, but they
            were busy after three o'clock in the afternoon, then it was pitch
            black and.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:30:58 And this is how we so it's like if someone would come and
            tell me, I would never believe that anyone could live like this for
            18 months, but we did.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:31:06 We live for 18 months with very little food no water except
            just to drink the water lips, you know and and the park and the MICE
            then six weeks before liberation.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:31:21 Would you believe that the German soldiers made there was
            spent in our prom.
          </p>
          <p>00:31:27 me there were spent because we're running a little.</p>
          <p>00:31:31 river, so the bronx is where they made their stand.</p>
          <p>
            00:31:37 They took over the phone it was for six weeks it was
            unbelievable the German soldiers slept on top of on top of the head.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:31:49 And at that time paddling system that he put their horses
            in the barn and the Germans in the one.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:31:56 They said it's Okay, and he said no, no it's much better if
            you'd have the horses here that warm and safe for him all kinds of
            excuses, because he wanted to have some kind of movement if they
            would hear something, and they should.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:32:09 I think it's the horses, they needed something a
            distraction, so he was very busy with the horses, there were a whole
            bunch of German soldiers on top of us, and we could hear them inhale
            is sick of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:32:21 And for the six weeks, my father had his hand on my mouth
            and nose constantly after big you want to sneeze or you want to
            cough or anything, and we have, I can still remember.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:32:35 hearing me inhaling, of course, of a laughing and talking
            about smoking a cigarette became here, because it was it wasn't a
            very high haystack and it was Okay, but it wasn't a huge and they
            went out and we run the bottom.

        <div class="paragraphs">
          <p>
            00:32:50 And it's like when I think about it, it it's like
            unbelievable that it could happen there, we could survive I don't
            even know how we give us foot.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:32:59 In those six weeks, they were there, he took such chances
            and, of course, my father had empty out the path I don't know how I
            I don't I don't know it was.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:33:10 It was just a miracle, it was just a miracle and, of
            course, when they retreated you know the oversaw for the retreated
            and we still we stayed with him for.
          </p>
          <p>00:33:21 A few weeks at least.</p>
          <p>
            00:33:24 Because, first of all, he was afraid for his neighbors
            should they have known that they saved Jews, they would have killed
            him with his family he's all neighbors.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:33:35 plus the fact they were many Jews killed afterwards, so it
            is about common gas from the hiding places into timing for touching
            they would be they would be slaughtered, so he kept us for a few
            more weeks to make sure, and so things stabilized a little bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:33:52 And that's when we call that the whole and we couldn't even
            work, we were holding on to sticks for support and.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:34:08 i'm sorry we had to stop for around noise outside but i'm
            continuing with telling me when you got out of the home, I also want
            to mention.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:34:18 Before how I felt as a child in during the time I was so
            envious of a bird excited I wanted to be a bird I said Oh, why was I
            born in for.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:34:29 A while was my born a dog and cat just so that I could sit
            outside and not be afraid that i'm going to be killed because i'm
            Jewish I always remember thinking that when I was in the hall.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:34:41 Oh God I just love to be a good and fly, just to be able to
            be outside because my my wish my only way she has to be able to sit
            outside and not be afraid that I was going to be killed.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:34:54 Anyhow, I was saying about the after river liberated by the
            Russians, the Russians liberated us.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:35:00 And Pablo captors for a few more weeks to make sure the
            things is a little bit more stable before we started back into town
            to teaching and we had to be very careful that he was not involved
            with us that we either not help us in any way because he would have
            been in danger as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:35:20 In the meantime, the whole time that we were hidden my
            parents were always thanking God for my sister Thank God that she
            doesn't have to do what we have here.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:35:32 that she has a home and such nice people and they put that
            back to her, but as soon as we are liberated will take a back you
            know she's not gonna they're not going to keep her on will find her
            and whatever little that we now it's six weeks after my father left
            there, she was killed.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:35:51 They made the announcement in town and they will find
            Jewish children in Christian homes they're going to kill everyone so
            she got afraid if it has been the principal and she said, go find
            your father.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:36:04 She sent her out and even though my sister did not look
            Jewish, it was a small town and his school child recognized as being
            a Jewish child and called the Germans.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:36:17 And I understand from witnesses that saw was gone gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:36:23 They they punished her They beat her they wanted they knew
            that a child was going someplace you know where we were I often say
            I would have I would have told and and she would not tell them where
            she was going, and so they tortured her until they killed him.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:36:41 And we didn't know and after we were liberated my parents
            did not want to believe it either they thought, maybe some made up
            story.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:36:48 They try to get a hold of the principal they're going to
            find a you know, and for many years afterwards I had this strange
            imagination i'm gonna go i'm gonna i'll be sitting on a bus and my
            sister is going to come up.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:37:00 I just couldn't believe it either well afterwards, when we
            find that and we were the people said he saw her being killed.
          </p>
          <p>
            00:37:08 We had accepted because my parents got very depressed and
            and I was screaming all the time or my sister or my system and it
            didn't take long, I mean i'm running away from myself for a minute.

          <p>
            We were sitting so around. So forlorn and helpless when the door
            opened and an angel in the form of a man entered the house. This was
            Pavlo Gerashenchuk. He said he had come to see how we were doing. He
            felt very sorry for us innocent Jews. We told him about the
            dangerous situation in which we found ourselves. We wanted to get
            out of the ghetto for at least a few days, but were very scared.
            When he saw how terrified we were he said to me, "If it is only for
            a few days, then you and your family can stay with me. Come now with
            me back to my farm." He had noted that at this time there were no
            guards at the ghetto gates who tried to stop him from entering and
            there were none were at the bridge either (Over the Horyn River). We
            decided that my wife and younger daughter Luba should go back to his
            farm away with Pavlo. Our older daughter Hannah would stay at our
            old house with the principal and his wife and I would stay in the
            ghetto to see what was happening.
          </p>
          <p>
            My beloved wife left the house with a very sad heart. She thought
            she was going to be away for only a few days. Of course, she did not
            realize that she was saying goodbye to our daughter Hannah, to her
            mother, her sister, the rest of her family, and all her friends for
            the last time. She kissed Hannah on her forehead and said goodbye.
            She left the house with Luba and with tears in her eyes. So she and
            Luba went quietly and traveled safely with Pavlo back to his house.
            It was dark when they arrived at his farm. After not eating all day,
            Pavlo gave them bread and milk. He then placed my wife and Luba in a
            bedroom. My wife could not sleep at all that night. She was so
            afraid that someone had seen them making the trip to the farm and
            would report them to the militia who would come and take her and our
            child away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, in the ghetto, we were very scared and worried and did
            not know if they had arrived at Pavlo's home safely. I was
            especially scared because about the same time, my younger brother
            was on his way to an another farmer’s house in Shipcov. This
            farmer’s name was Vasil Ritcordubsky, and he was a terrible
            murderer. My brother had given him everything he owned in return for
            a promise to try and save his life. Instead Vasil Ritcordubsky
            murdered him.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the ghetto many small groups of people were talking quietly
            outside on the street. I went from one group to another hoping to
            hear a sliver of good news, but I heard only the opposite. Wherever
            I went, I heard terrible news. Some said that they had heard all men
            and women over fifty years old would be killed and those younger
            would be kept alive to work. Another group said that they had heard
            that only the first class workers - the specialists – would be
            spared and everyone else would die. A third group said why try to
            fool ourselves, our graves were already dug under the town of
            Grabnik and waiting for all of us to be killed and buried.
          </p>
          <p>
            We continued to try to think of some way to protect ourselves from
            the terrible murderers. The gate to the ghetto was still open and
            not guarded. Hannah came to the ghetto from the principal’s home to
            visit us and I told her that her mother and sister were safe. She
            asked what people in the ghetto were saying. Hannah spent a few days
            in the ghetto with us and then returned the principal and his wife
            in our house. I asked Hannah to return to the ghetto the next day. I
            gave her some additional clothes, walked her back to our old home,
            and kissed her good bye.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later that day, before nighttime, there was much talk in the ghetto
            that something was going to happen that night. When I heard about
            this, I went with two friends to spend the night at Samuel Gilberg's
            house. He was the only Jew in Tuchin who was allowed to stay in his
            own house, outside the ghetto, because he owned a factory that made
            overcoats for the Germans. Many other people, including Joseph
            Cooperstein and his wife, also went to the Gilberg home. We all sat
            around until very late at night trying to reassure one another that
            everything would be alright. Then we all laid down in our clothes on
            to try and take a nap. We had all been sleeping in our regular
            clothes for a long time in the ghetto.
          </p>
          <p>
            At about 5:00 am, we heard screaming in the street. Ukrainian
            policemen were knocking on doors of the house and they were full of
            rage. They began throwing all us out of the house and beat us with
            their rifles. Outside, there were hundreds of Ukrainian policemen
            who pushed us towards the ghetto. At the gate of the ghetto, there
            was a large group of militia. After we passed through the gate ,
            they locked it tight. Most people in the ghetto were asleep and did
            not realize the ghetto had been surrounded by the militia. In about
            fifteen minutes, most people came out into the streets and it became
            very noisy and crazy. We realized the end was near. There was
            nowhere to run from what seemed to be a sure death sentence. The
            time flew - 6:00, 6:30, 7:00. Now an order came from the Yuden‑Rat -
            fifty workers (bricklayers and carpenters) were needed to work in
            town. There was a big rush to the gate by almost everyone who said
            they wanted to go. They hoped that somehow they could get out of the
            ghetto as a worker and then try to escape. There were many Ukrainian
            militia and a smaller number of German SS men and they were hitting
            and beating anyone who tried to escape. It seemed impossible to
            actually get out, but people continued to push towards the gate in a
            last ditch effort to escape from death.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was running around in a crazed state. I knew that Hannahle would
            soon be trying to come visit me as I had asked her to do the day
            before. If the Militia or SS men saw her outside the ghetto she
            would be and become trapped. This would destroy all our last hope to
            save our child. I kept running back and forth to the fence. We were
            surrounded by policeman with their rifles and they were ready to
            shoot. My house, now occupied by the principal was across the street
            (Noscordovsky Street) from the ghetto.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 8:00 am I was desperate. I knew that at any moment, I could lose
            our child. I knew that I already had more than 90% chance of being
            killed anyway, so I decided to jump over the fence across the street
            from my house. Standing near me at the time were my two sisters,
            Miriam and Sarah, my mother‑in‑law, and some other family members.
            They were crying and holding me back. They were sure if I jumped
            over the fence the Militia men, who were marching around with their
            rifles loaded, would shoot and kill me. I waited for a moment when
            the officer nearest the fence to me looked away, and I jumped and
            ran across the street to my house. When the militiaman heard some
            noise, he started shooting at me. I ran through the back door of my
            house and through the hall to a secret door under the steps that I
            had built before. I sat in my hiding place shaking and petrified,
            but heard no more shots. I also did not hear anyone running after
            me. The guard probably did not want to leave his assigned position.
          </p>
          <p>
            I laid down in my secret spot for about fifteen minutes to catch my
            breath and think what I should do next. I was still very afraid that
            Hannah would soon try to go and visit me in the ghetto. So I ran out
            of my spot and then opened the door loudly so everyone inside would
            think that I had just come from outside. As calmly as I could, I
            said, "Good morning," and asked, "Where is Hannahle?" The wife
            answered that she was still in bed. She asked me why I came so
            early. I did not tell her that the ghetto was surrounded. I told her
            that I had heard they might be closing the ghetto gate and begged
            her to not let Hannah go outside and to be very careful with her. I
            then went to the bedroom where Hannah was sleeping and saw my
            beautiful child, who was still lying in bed but already awake. I
            gave her a kiss and she said she was so very happy to see me. She
            asked why I had come so early. I told her what had happened in the
            ghetto and warned her to be very careful. I told her to go to the
            attic, which was another secret spot that I had told the principal
            about, if she heard anything unusual. I also told her that I could
            not go outside now and I was going to hide in the secret spot under
            the steps. I kissed Hannah and then said goodbye to the Mrs.
            Lamatchuk and told her once more to be very careful. Then I went out
            and slammed the door like I was leaving, but quickly opened it back
            up and hid under the steps. This area led to a barn.
          </p>
          <p>
            I removed a brick from the foundation of the barn so I could see
            outside. I could only see a little, but I could hear every noise.
            There was much screaming and crying in the ghetto. Later, I could
            hear a man named Matron tell the principal that they were planning
            to kill all the Jews tomorrow. He said they were waiting for some SS
            troops to come from Rovnah to carry out this assignment. I later
            learned that when the Yudan Rad, (Jewish representative) Getzel
            Schvartzman, went to see the Gebitz (SS) commissioner to discuss
            something, instead of being greeted like usual, he was thrown out of
            the building and made fun of him. Schvartzman returned to the ghetto
            and told everyone that the situation was very bad and that he
            thought everyone was going to die. When he told this to the people,
            I could hear the loud cries and screams from my hiding spot. At this
            time some people killed themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was then decided by some of the leaders, that when they heard the
            first gunshot, everyone would start fires in their homes and that
            everyone would run in one direction towards the cemetery which led
            to the forest. Everyone felt that there was nothing to lose. So many
            men prepared to burn their houses using gasoline, kerosine, and
            straw.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it started to get dark, I heard the first gunshot and then this
            was followed by wild loud screaming that echoed up to the skies. The
            shooting was continuous. The screams ended, but the shooting
            continued. Soon I saw black smoke and it appeared the whole ghetto
            was burning.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I sat in a state of shock in my hiding place, I heard a noise
            near my secret door. Then I heard the voice of my dear child who had
            sneaked out of her hiding spot in the attic and come to my hiding
            spot. She started crying very quietly and asked me to please take
            her with me when I left. She was so scared of the fire and all the
            gunshots. From her secret hiding spot in the attic, she could see
            everything that was happening in the ghetto. I will never forgive
            myself for not letting her stay with me in my hiding spot at that
            time. I was afraid that if the principal and his wife did not find
            her in the attic, they would feel they could not trust her and might
            not want to keep her. I cried and pleaded with her as quietly as
            possible and begged her to keep calm and strong and return to the
            attic. I promised her that if anything dangerous happened, I would
            come and get her. I spoke to her not as a child, but like an adult.
            She understood and believed me and went back upstairs to the attic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ghetto fire was becoming worse and worse. We were in a very
            dangerous situation because any moment my house might start to burn.
            I was ready to run up to Hannah's secret attic spot if the house
            started burning. I wanted to be with her if we were caught in the
            flames so we would die together. By this time running away was not
            an option. There were many Ukrainian soldiers who were near the
            house and they shot at anyone who tried to run out of the ghetto.
            The ghetto burned all night. By the morning, the fire had become a
            little smaller. I was desperate to know how Hanna was doing. I was
            worried that she might have died of fear. For a while, I forgot
            about my family in the ghetto and could only think about my child.
            Every minute that passed seemed like an hour.
          </p>
          <p>
            The door to the house opened and the principal's wife went outside.
            I was sure that after such a fearful night she was going to see how
            my child was doing. But she did not have a mother's heart and
            instead went first to feed the chickens. Finally, she went up to the
            attic to see my child. I waited in fear to hear the voice of Hanna
            and finally, I heard her quiet sweet voice. I was so relieved to
            hear her and know that she was alive. I decided that after they
            brought Hanna some food that morning, I would go back up and see her
            in the attic. At about 9:00 am I snuck up to see her and she again
            told me again how scared she was of all the fire and gunshots. She
            sat in the dark in a corner of the attic and closed her eyes. She
            was shaking with fear and then she finally fell asleep. Hanna slept
            until the wife brought her some food. She told Hanna that there were
            no more Jews left in Tuchin because they had all been transported to
            Kiev to work. Both Hanna and I knew this was not true.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was desperate to find out what had happened to my sisters and
            other family members in the ghetto. I also need to know how my wife
            and Luba were doing in the village Shipkoff in Pavlo's house. I
            tried to stay strong and waited in hiding in the attic. I could see
            the ruins of the ghetto. All of the houses had been burned except
            for two. One house that remained was the house of Laab Ghait, the
            shoemaker, and the other belonged to Berl Saltzman. Among all the
            burned houses were many dead people. Men, women, and children were
            lying dead in the streets. A few German SS troops and Ukrainian
            militia with swastika armbands were ordering wagon drivers to pick
            up the dead bodies. Several drivers entered the two houses that had
            not burned and took everything of any value that was still inside. I
            remained hiding in the attic and watched two militiamen hit Sheptzel
            Marcus. He had been carrying a shovel and was probably going to dig
            his own grave. They caught several other survivors that afternoon.
            Then the Ukrainians went into all the Jewish homes which had been
            outside of the ghetto and started to dig up the ground looking for
            any valuables that may have been buried.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent that whole day with my child in the attic. I had eaten
            almost nothing for in two days. Hannah gave me some of her food. And
            then I went down back to my hiding spot. Beneath the stairs. I sat
            alone and thought of my lovely wife and child and my sisters and
            brother. I also thought about myself. How could I save myself? It
            would be impossible to stay here in this spot much longer. First of
            all, I had no food. In addition, I had no place to empty my bowels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each day I went up to see Hannah in the attic for a few hours and
            she would give me some of her food. I did not eat very much and
            actually was not hungry. On Shabbat, Hanna fearfully told me with
            fear that the Principal’s wife told her that in the afternoon she
            was going to take Hanna back into the regular part of the house
            because they were not killing any more Jews. I did not believe that
            this was true and thought she probably just wanted to calm Hannah
            down. In the afternoon, Hannah snuck down to my hiding spot and told
            me that she had seen a few Jews running past our house. She said
            that she saw Samuel Splocht and his wife Zelda. That made me a
            little relieved.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remained in my secret hiding spot until Monday morning. At about
            8:00 am, I csnuck out of my hiding spot and knocked on the door from
            the outside. When the the principal’s wife (Mrs. Lamatchuk) saw me,
            she became very scared. She asked me how I could have survived. I
            told her that I had been staying with a farmer in another town. I
            then kissed my child as if I had not seen her for days. The woman
            told me what had happened and how terrible the were murderers who
            had killed the Jews. She also told me how scared she was because the
            house had almost caught on fire when the ghetto was burning. The
            wind was blowing the fire towards the house. She said they were also
            very fearful and afraid to stand up because there was so much
            shooting around the house. She felt it was a miracle that they had
            not been killed.

          <div class="title"><h2>Yosef's Story</h2></div>
          <p>
            ​​Father made contact with a Ukrainian from the same village who had
            worked for him from time to time, and he agreed to hide us in his
            house. We moved to his house and hoped for good. The children of the
            Ukrainian boasted to the ears of their friends that a Jewish
            merchant was hiding with his family in their house. Many children
            came to see us as if to a zoo. The rumor spread in the village and
            again we were forced to flee. In the end Father made contact with
            Anton Ozertchuk, who had commercial connections with us. Anton was
            an orderly Ukrainian who belonged to the Baptist sect and knew how
            to keep a secret. Father spoke with Anton that he should come to
            take various objects as payment in return for our stay with him. My
            uncle Shmuel warned Father not to believe the gentile. He himself
            had given a villager wood to build a new house with a basement for
            him in a relatively isolated spot and paid him with a large amount
            of property, and in the end the man did not allow him to set foot in
            his house. Father was influenced by the story and when Anton came to
            take objects as agreed, Father gave him things that were less
            valuable, so that he would not cut off the relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a number of days passed, Anton told us that together with us
            in the hayloft was another family from Tuchyn, who had arrived at
            the time of the burning of the ghetto. This was the family of
            Eliyahu Shteingold. We pulled down the divider of straw that was
            between us and them, and together we were nine souls. From Eliyahu
            we learned details of the night of the fire in the ghetto.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the cold grew we could not hold out any longer in the hayloft.
            Anton offered to dig a shelter under the cowshed. Father, Eliyahu
            and my eldest brother worked together with Anton during the nights.
            It was a pit of about two meters by three meters and about 150
            centimeters deep. Above the pit a ceiling of wood was installed that
            was covered with straw and with garbage, and it was not noticeable
            that under the floor of the cowshed people were living. The walls of
            the pit were covered with straw in order to reduce the dampness. The
            floor we padded with straw. They also put in a bunk [the word he
            uses, <span>דרגש</span>, can also be "bench"; it suggests a low
            narrow wooden or metal bed such as seen in old army bases/hospitals
            (or concentration camps for that matter)] on which the women and the
            little children slept. My father, Eliyahu and my eldest brother
            organized themselves under the bunk. For my brother Aharon they
            organized a board hung above the large bunk. They also installed a
            type of chimney on an angle that was supposed to supply us with
            light and air. The idea was indeed pleasant, but the next day Anton
            came in a panic and said that from the chimney steam was coming out
            that looked like smoke. We blocked the chimney from the inside with
            a window of glass and at least we had only a little bit of light in
            the afternoon hours. And with regard to air, we made an opening into
            the cowshed but not outside. The exit from the pit was through the
            cowshed. Over the opening was a wooden cover hidden in a pile of
            straw. In the corner was a bucket that was used to relieve our
            needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the summer a sense of suffocation prevailed in the pit. Most of
            the time we sat or lay doing nothing. When the heat grew we would
            remove our outer clothing. When a little light flickered in the
            afternoon we would all crowd together next to the source of light
            and delouse ourselves. We relieved our needs in front of everyone.
            And as if we had any choice?
          </p>
          <p>
            Anton would come to us early in the morning, before it was light,
            and would bring us soup, bread and water for the entire day. At the
            same opportunity he would take the bucket, empty it, and return it
            clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bread would be divided by Eliyahu into nine equal portions. Each
            one would receive a thin slice for the whole day. In the evening
            Anton would appear again with soup or with potatoes. I would keep my
            portion of bread for two days and even three days. The dry bread I
            would suck like a sweet. The slice of bread kept me occupied
            endlessly. When the bread crumbled completely, I ate it delicately,
            crumb by crumb separately.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sitting there doing nothing weighed on us, but over the course
            of time we grew used to it. We would sit for hours and tell the same
            stories again and again for who knows how many times. Especially
            often were told the stories of the good days, of the plethora of
            delicacies that would be prepared for a holiday, so that even half
            of them no one could succeed in finishing off. I was not able to
            understand how food could be within arm's reach and not be eaten.
            There were hours and days when the despair took control of us.
          </p>
          <p>
            My parents and the Shteingold couple would discuss our
            situation-without-an-exit. To them it was clear that we had no
            chance of surviving. So in the name of what was all the suffering?
            And what if the Germans were to win the war? My parents were envious
            of those who had died at the beginning of the war and who were rid
            of the hardships that had struck us. They were especially frightened
            of a cruel death by torture, "a strange death." [I guess he is
            quoting something here, but I have no idea what.] My parents' view
            was that a natural death and [burial in] a tomb of Israel were

            All these conversations caused disturbances to my sleep. I lived in
            constant fear that they would murder my parents in front of my eyes.
            Nightmarish nights passed for me. My mother would make efforts to
            calm me. She whispered different stories in my ears to encourage me
            out of my depression. The adults were suspicious of the whisperings
            between me and my mother and would ask to stop them so as not to
            disturb their rest and not to create any noise outside. I made
            efforts not to doze off by day. Our neighbors helped me with this.
            It offered the chance that perhaps I would sleep at night.

            Anton was a quiet and responsible man. He did not speak of us to his
            [younger] children and to his adult daughters he only revealed the
            secret after some time. Even with his brother-in-law who lived
            nearby he was cautious and did not tell him. We did not imagine that
            we would spend a year and a half in the prison that was underneath
            the cowshed. In the beginning we thought that it was a matter of a
            number of weeks. But the weeks passed one after the other and our
            powers of endurance seemed to be running out. To our good fortune
            came the constant encouragement of Anton. He would appear every
            evening and tell of the defeats of the Germans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until today I remember for the good Anton's wife. She too encouraged
            and comforted us. She trusted in supervision from above and did not
            even oppose our moving to live in their house. In contrast with her,
            Anton, who stuck to his mission, was very strict about being
            careful. He forbade making noises and demanded that we speak in
            whispers. We grew used to whispering. When we emerged from the pit I
            marveled that people were speaking out loud. In the winter of 1942
            to 1943, Anton was struck by a crisis. He would come to us
            frightened. There were rumors that villagers had been executed,
            together with the members of their households, because they were
            hiding Jews on their farms. He was extremely religious and he did
            not understand how such terrible things could happen and the world
            could behave as usual. Once he told Mother that it was not the fear
            of his own death and that of his wife that frightened him, but the
            small children, who did not even know that he was hiding Jews, how
            were they to blame?
          </p>
          <p>
            I am reminded of a terrible incident that broke out between my
            parents and Anton. This was in the spring of 1943. Anton had been
            ordered to bury a family of Ukrainians who had been executed for the
            crime of hiding Jews. He came to us agitated and ordered us to come
            up out of the pit into the cowshed. He told us of the incident,
            spoke and wept. It seems he felt the terrible responsibility that he
            had taken on when he brought us into his house. He ordered us to
            kneel and to pray with him for the peace of those killed and to ask
            God to bring an end to the troubles. My mother explained to Anton
            that for Jews it was forbidden to kneel. Anton did not understand
            and was severely offended. He was endangering the lives of his
            family and his neighbors who had helped Jews had been murdered, and
            we were being stubborn about an insignificant thing! … And his mind
            could not rest until he ordered us to go back down into the shelter
            and to leave [his property] at night. He left and now an argument
            broke out among the adults. There were those who said that in a time
            of danger it was even permitted to kneel for a short time and only
            so as not to sour relations with our panicked benefactor. It was
            clear that if Anton would expel us, this would be a certain death.
            My mother was determined in her view that in any case there was no
            certainty that we would come out of the war alive, and therefore
            there was no point in both kneeling and also dying afterwards. She
            saw kneeling as being in effect conversion and she was prepared to
            die as a martyr. At night Anton came. And again there was a
            conversation between him and Mother. Mother argued that there was
            one God in heaven and that we all prayed only to Him, each one
            according to the customs of his forefathers, and there was no need
            to change the sacred customs of each group. We had not even tasted
            meat out of the strictures of kashrut. It seems that Anton thought a
            lot that day. In the end he became reconciled and left us alone to
            stay on. I think the Russian prisoner who worked for Anton helped us
            greatly by softening Anton up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anton was skilled with his hands and knew how to perform every
            trade. He was a tailor and a shoemaker. Sometimes he was also
            occupied in teaching and as a veterinarian. After the murders of the
            Jews, there was a demand for various skilled tradesmen and Anton did
            not miss an opportunity. He was always busy and really became
            wealthy. He was convinced that because of us God had sent a blessing
            in his handiwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time the activities of the Bandrovists grew. Once the
            gangs visited the village of Pustomyt. It happened that the gangs
            housed their headquarters on Anton's farm and Anton then demanded of
            us to be doubly cautious. He would bring us a large amount of bread
            and water and would say that he could not know when he would be able
            to visit us. We were forced to reduce our portions of food then.
            Anton was strict with us and did not endanger his family and that
            was for the good. He had signs that told of danger. The strong
            barking of dogs at a distance would tell of the coming of German
            soldiers or gangs and then he would hurry to equip us with bread and
            water in large quantities and warn us not to let out even a murmur.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day Anton brought millstones to the pit and we began to grind
            wheat seeds for flour for him. For us it was an occupation and for
            Anton it was a great saving in work. Once Germans appeared at the
            home of a Ukrainian who had been informed upon that he was grinding
            the grains in his house and was not paying the tax quota that the
            authorities had imposed. The Ukrainian fled and the next day there
            came to the village a penal military company. They surrounded the
            village and caught all the residents who had not managed to flee.
            They placed them in a number of houses, poured fuel on the houses,
            and burned everyone alive. Among them was the married daughter of
            Anton and her family. Anton was under great tension: He was hiding
            us and at the same time his daughter and her children were murdered
            in a collective punishment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ukrainians hoped that soon they would have their own independent
            country, and for this reason they pestered the Poles. Many Poles ran
            away from their homes and the Ukrainians robbed their property. They
            spread a rumor that from now on the Jews would be able to walk about
            freely and they would not trouble them. They announced their war
            against the Germans and the Poles in order to free
          </p>
          <p>
            their land and the Jews were not an obstacle on the way to their
            independence.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the neighboring village Kodrinka, Poles fled from the threat of
            the Ukrainians. And then many Jews came out from their hiding places
            in the forests and settled in the houses of the Poles. They indeed
            wandered around freely and carried on ostensibly normal lives and
            even established commercial connections with the Ukrainians and also
            worked for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were those who also came to the house of Anton and among them
            were our relatives. There were Yeshaya Shef, may his memory be for a
            blessing, and Uri, [or Ori?] may he live long. Father, who saw them
            through a crack in the wall of the cowshed, asked Anton for
            permission to go out one night to meet a number of Jews. Perhaps
            from their mouths he would hear important things. Anton opposed this
            strongly. He said one could not trust in snakes and by this he meant
            Ukrainians. One day they would exterminate all the Jews. When Father
            stood firm with his request, Anton told him that if he insisted we
            should all go out and not come back again. We had stayed alive
            thanks to his carefulness and if we would ease up on the strictures
            it would become known that there were Jews in the area. It would be
            a pity to die after so much suffering.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the year 1943 it was already known that the Germans
            were being defeated. It was told that the Soviets were landing heavy
            blows on the Germans and that the war was approaching its end. At
            nights we heard the echoes of shots. When we heard explosions
            nearby, we were happy. After a number of days passed, it seemed that
            the thunder of cannons was growing more distant. Anton calmed us and
            said that the front was wide and that battles were taking place
            along its entire length. When the front came near to our village,
            the villagers ran away from their houses to the nearby woods. Anton
            and his family also fled. The Russian prisoner stayed in the house.
            He invited Father into the house. That was the first time since we
            had entered the shelter that Father spent time inside Anton's home.
            Father returned to the pit and told of the foods he had seen in
            Anton's house. It was hard for us to grasp that people were eating
            eggs, meat, milk, and more. This was a year and a half that our menu
            had been composed of a thin slice of bread, soup, or potatoes. We
            had forgotten about the existence of other food items.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the beginning of January 1944, the Russians entered Pustomyt. The
            joy was great. Anton and his household members returned home. We
            came up out of the pit but we did not go out of the cowshed. Despite
            the joy of the salvation, Anton demanded that we stay in the shelter
            until a stable local government would be established. He was always
            careful and measured in his actions. In the end it became clear that
            he was right. The Soviets were already in place but the chaos was
            terrible. The gangs did not put down their weapons and every day
            there were people killed. There was no point in losing one's life
            because of a careless step.
