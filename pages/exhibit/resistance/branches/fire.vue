            ​The winter of 1942 arrived. With the beginning of the cold, an
            order was issued to bring furs. Jews handed their furs over to the
            German army and at the same time warmed their souls with the news
            that came from the front about the large losses of the Germans. Once
            again hope reemerged that we would be privileged to see the defeat
            of the enemy.
          </p>
          <p>
            My brother David, Yitzchak Portnoy, Aharon Marakish, Nissel
            Zilberberg, Ludvik Gross, Chaim Rozenberg, Mottel German, [and]
            Shmuel Shteingold began searching for a way to the partisans. In the
            area of the village Richytsya, Russian paratroopers would sometimes
            land. For the most part, the fate of the paratroopers was bitter.
            Many of them were caught and executed. The Ukrainians would hand
            them over to the Germans.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day, Vornitski came to my father. He was Russian, well known by
            my parents, who did not place the greatest trust in him. He said he
            was in contact with the partisans and was prepared to act as the
            liaison between the young Jews and the partisans, on condition that
            the Jews had their own weapons. After much hesitation it was decided
            to take the risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every day young people would leave Tuchyn (around 50 people) to chop
            down trees in the forests. Nachum Balinski was the head of the group
            that was discussed with Vornitski. That day the Judenrat doubled the
            number of people going out to the forest. Both my brothers, David
            and Liova, also went out to the forest that day to chop down trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was agreed with Vornitski that someone from the partisans would
            wait for the young people and would lead them to their [the
            partisans'] camp. The young people went out to the forest and worked
            until the late hours, and no one came. Disappointed, the young
            people returned to their homes.

            The youths [of the town] began to assemble and to plan their
            actions. In our house they would endanger themselves: Aharon
            Marakish, Yitzchak Portnoy, Nissel Zilberberg, Mottel German, Shmuel
            Shteingold, Chaya Apel, Basia Valdman, my brothers David and Liova,
            and me. The focus of our thoughts was on how to obtain weapons. We
            knew that the Russians, at the time that they were retreating, hid
            weapons and that the Ukrainians in the area knew about this. We
            found a connection to a Ukrainian fellow from Shubkiv, Vasil
            Klimtchuk. His nickname between us was ”Itchke.” Slowly they
            prepared him for it, that we were planning with his help to obtain
            weapons. He had been called up in his time to the Russian army and
            afterwards had returned home. In the army “Itchke” had been with my
            brother Leib. He knew our family, and we dared to make contact with
            him. We told the Judenrat about this. There they told us to buy
            weapons at any price. The Judenrat funded the purchase. We received
            from “Itchke” eight rifles and 17 grenades. In order to transfer the
            rifles in secret, their barrels had to be shortened. This labor was
            done by the mechanic Borkovitch, a refugee from Poland, together
            with my brother David. They transferred the weapons to the basement
            of the Judenrat and hid them there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tuchyn had come refugees who had escaped from the Hushcha ghetto
            when the “<i>aktzia</i>” started there. The Ukrainian police led
            everyone to the gendarmerie. In Richytsya (a village next to Tuchyn)
            they shot all these Jews. Levitski helped the gendarmes in their
            work of murder. The Volksdeutsche also took part in this activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Judenrat felt that the problem of the ghetto was inevitable. To
            Tuchyn came many Germans, the gendarmerie was replaced, to all the
            public institutions came new commanders, [and] the situation
            worsened. Commandant Grabner called my father in one day and placed
            a large order: “I am going to the fatherland for a vacation,” he
            explained, “and I need to bring something for the family.” He said,
            among other things, that his place would be filled by the commandant
            from Voroniv, Weck. Grabner said, “Shvartzman, I must tell you that
            tough times will now fall on you and on the Jews of Tuchyn.”
          </p>
          <p>
            My father understood the hint and in the Judenrat they started
            planning actions. First and foremost it was decided to order from
            the cooperative large quantities of kerosene. Working there at that
            time were Ofens the lame and Yakub the tall. They were told that the
            kerosene was needed for the workshops. For the kerosene they [the
            Jews] paid as much as the two of them demanded. The kerosene was
            entered into the area of the designated ghetto. The Judenrat made
            contact with the Jews working in Shubkiv and explained to them that
            they also needed to look out for kerosene and to transfer it to the
            city. Among those who dragged kerosene to the Judenrat from Shubkiv
            [were]: Natan Samorzhov, Leizer Sondelzon, Avraham Gilman, and
            others. The commandant Weck from Voroniv (a village next to Tuchyn)
            was already known in the city. The previous autumn he had come to
            Tuchyn riding on a horse together with a young Ukrainian woman. He
            caused a disturbance in the city, hit out with his whip, shot [his
            gun] in the streets, and shouted: “Too many Jews are wandering
            around here in the streets.” My father went out towards him and
            invited him in to the Judenrat. Weck said clothing for men and for
            women was needed urgently, in order to distribute to the Ukrainians
            ahead of the harvest festival. The people of the Judenrat collected
            clothes and presented them to him. Weck would visit Tuchyn
            frequently and demanded all kinds of objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Towards the evening Ukrainian police came to guard the ghetto. It
            was impossible already that evening to go out. One in a while shots
            were heard. On Sunday the last of the Jews of Tuchyn moved from the
            town into the ghetto. That day all the Jews still went out to their
            places of work. They were led by Ukrainian police to the workshops
            that were outside the area of the ghetto to work that day. The Jews
            returned after work escorted by the police.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Sunday evening (the day after Yom Kippur) the ghetto was
            surrounded by Ukrainian police and it was prohibited to leave the
            area of the ghetto. At night we heard isolated shots. On Monday in
            the morning there were already Jews who had been killed. These were
            Jews who had tried to jump over the fence to the other side and
            escape. They were all caught and shot. On Monday morning already the
            Jews did not go out to work. The ghetto was surrounded. In the area
            of the ghetto were all the synagogues. The Germans had turned them
            into grain storehouses. There was a huge supply of seeds there. Many
            Germans came from Rivne to Tuchyn. There was a great bustling around
            the ghetto area; in charge of everything was the commandant Weck.
            Inside the ghetto, preparations began for action. People went from
            house to house and distributed cans of kerosene according to the
            instructions of the Judenrat. In this work took part: the Shulman
            brothers, the Markus brothers, Vova Turok, Natan Samorzhov, Yaakov
            Varni, Aharon Marakish, my two brothers David and Liova, and others.
            Other men also had weapons. As well as this, they also distributed
            the weapons they had prepared beforehand in the Judenrat. Everything
            was planned during the day. My father and Himelfarb came in contact
            with these young men.

            It is hard for me to describe the picture. The noise and the
            commotion were great. Women searched for their husbands, children
            for their parents. Bitter weeping and cries of “<i>Shema Yisrael</i
            >” and in all this commotion the young people began shooting at the
            Germans and the Ukrainians and throwing grenades.
          </p>
          <p>
            – “Jews, save your souls!” I heard my father's voice call. Young
            people broke the fence. Jews burst outside running. About 2,000 Jews
            managed to get to the forests. The Germans and the Ukrainians were
            confused, they shot at the people fleeing and many fell. German
            reinforcements arrived. The Germans did not enter the ghetto, they
            shot from the other side.
          </p>
          <p>
            I fled from the ghetto together with my little sister, Basia. I did
            not know anything about the rest of my family. I was dragged along
            with the flow of escapees and I held my little sister by the hand. I
            ran with my sister to our house on the sands. Our elderly nanny,
            Zosia, was still at home. She hid the two of us. At night she moved
            us to the house of our neighbors, the Russians Krivesky They agreed
            to hide us in their house. They hid us in the basement. In the
            Krivesky family was a son and two sisters with their families.
            Krivesky the son was in his time a good friend of my brother. To our
            family he had a special relationship. He would come and bring news
            and tell us what was happening in the ghetto. Krivesky returned on
            Wednesday and told us that the Jews were still shooting from the
            ghetto and that there were people injured and killed among the
            Germans and the Ukrainians. From Krivesky's mouth I was informed of
            the details of the last moments of my father. My father stayed in
            the ghetto until the first day of the Sukkot holiday. On that day he
            went out of the ghetto towards the Germans. Weck was at that time
            next to the ghetto. He approached my father together with other
            Germans, offered him a cigarette and asked him:
          </p>

          <p>– “Shvartzman, who gave the order to set the ghetto on fire?”</p>
          <p>
            – “I did,” replied my father. “Know, Weck, that the Germans will be
            defeated … Our blood will be avenged by others … You will not
            destroy the entire Jewish people … Never will you be forgiven for
            the blood you have spilled! …”
          </p>
          <p>
            Weck listened to my father's words. He did not reply, he let him
            talk. Afterwards, he asked:
          </p>
          <p>– “Shvartzman, do you have gold?”</p>
          <p>My father took out his gold watch and offered it to the German.</p>
          <p>– “What is your last request, Shvartzman?” asked Weck.</p>
          <p>– “I ask that you shoot me in the Jewish cemetery.”</p>
          <p>
            Weck, together with the gendarmerie, led my father to the Jewish
            cemetery. He shot him with his own hands.

            ​​On the fourth day they locked the gate of the ghetto. The
            commissar demanded that a list of the workers be prepared. There
            were those who hoped and believed that they would not kill everyone
            and that it would be possible to ransom some of the Jews. They began
            to collect gold. Craftsmen said that without their families they
            would not choose to live either. In the meantime, numerous Ukrainian
            policemen gathered around the ghetto. We heard voices singing German
            songs. A rumor spread that an S.S. unit had come to the town. It was
            clear that the game was lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the afternoon Meir Himmelfarb, the deputy head of the Judenrat,
            invited the public to the synagogue and made a speech in emotional
            words: "Jews, the last moments of our lives have arrived. We have
            nothing to lose. The enemies ordered us to bring all our possessions
            to the ghetto, [and] surrounded us with a high fence with the aim
            that all our property would be concentrated in one place, protected
            from the local population. The intention is clear: They want to win
            our property and to execute us. We will not let our enemies inherit
            from us. Every Jew will prepare flammable material, and whoever does
            not have any can come to me and receive a bottle of kerosene. When
            the suitable moment comes, everyone will set his house on fire."
          </p>
          <p>
            There were a few Jews who committed suicide. Aharon Kaplan, Shaike
            Zeitchik and Shmuel Markus dropped themselves down a well, Mottel
            Kashtan poisoned himself, and Mottel Vizlech cut open his own veins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Towards the evening Germans and Ukrainian police entered the ghetto.
            They ordered the Jews to disperse to their houses. Meir Himmelfarb
            went into his house and set the house on fire. After a few minutes
            the whole ghetto was in flames. The police who were guarding around
            [the ghetto] began to shoot. The bullets were fired from all
            directions and the impression was as if there was shooting from the
            ghetto. The police scattered. At the same time the Jews broke
            through the fence in numerous places and fled in every direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the morning the local residents caught the Jews who had escaped
            into the gardens, the fields and the barns, and turned them in to
            the Gestapo. The villagers also did the same thing. They robbed
            their property and murdered them or handed them over to the Gestapo.
